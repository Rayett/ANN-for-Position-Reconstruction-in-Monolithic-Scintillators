# ANN-for-Position-Reconstruction-in-Monolithic-Scintillators
The challenge was divide in 3 portions:
  1) multiclass classification
  2) analysis of regression dataset
  3) regression modelling challenge

The challenge was organized by the RADLab laboratory of the Department of Electronics at Politecnico di Milano. Its objective was to demonstrate the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in the field of nuclear medicine. All datasets were generated in-house using a system consisting of a LaBr₃ monolithic scintillator coupled with 64 silicon photomultipliers. The X-ray signals were produced using a ^137Cs radioactive source, which was positioned within the region of interest for dataset generation. Two different positioning systems were employed to acquire the two datasets used respectively for classification and regression tasks.

### MULTICLASS CLASSIFICATION
The dataset used in this study consisted of signals acquired from 64 silicon photomultipliers, along with a target variable containing four distinct classes. These classes corresponded to four quadrants of the scintillator, defined by its division into top/bottom and left/right regions. For ulterior details look into the code file.

### REGRESSION DATASET
This dataset also comprises signals from the 64 channels of the SiPM array. However, in contrast to the previous classification dataset, a significantly higher-resolution positioning strategy was employed. The scintillator was no longer divided into just four regions. Instead, the radioactive source was mounted on a motorized system capable of precise movements with a step size of 1.56 mm along both dimensions of the scintillator. Additionally, the X-ray beam was collimated to a diameter of 1 mm. The dataset was generated by systematically scanning the entire scintillator surface, recording the SiPM channel signals at each position, and using the corresponding coordinates of the collimated source as the target output.

### CHALLENGE

The challenge took the form of a competition in which participants were required to train a model on the provided dataset and submit it to the organizers for evaluation on a separate test set, which was not made available to the participants. The chosen performance metric was a custom score, defined as the mean of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). 

## RESULTS
Among nearly one hundred submissions, the proposed model achieved a commendable **FOURTH**-place ranking. The slight performance drop on the test set was likely due to mild overfitting. Overall, the result was very positive—especially considering that the organizers also provided a benchmark score obtained from an in-house model, which was surpassed by over two-thirds of the submitted models.
